1. :heavy_check_mark: `User` may create a Stall
1. :heavy_check_mark: `User` may see a list of available `Stall`s
1. `User` may create a pending `RentalRequest` for a `Stall`
1. `Stall` owner may see pending `RentalRequest`s
1. `RentalRequest`s requester may see pending `RentalRequest`s
1. `Stall` owner may deny `RentalRequest`s for their `Stall`

## Learning Goals

1. Creating secure user registration and login
1. Building web applications with several related

1. Sharing a

   across multiple views

## Imporant Philosophical Ramblings
**Good programs share the right data in the right form with the right people**.

Consider Uber: It combines your location, your ability to pay, and your desire to
travel a short distance and shares that with someone who is able to drive you.
It then shares that persons car information and distance so you can get in the
right car and be transported across the city; after which it transfers some data
from your credit card to their bank account.

From a technical perspective this isn't terribly complex. It has been solved in
the past with well-staffed call centers and radios. The reason Uber is "winning"
is because it automates away the cost of the call center and radios and lowers
the barriers to sharing the data to a few taps.

As a web developer, your job is to figure out what is the right data, what is
the right form fo rthat data, and who is the right people to have access to the
data.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repo
1. cd into it
1. Open `docs/mockups.png` file; Check that out!
1. Open `docs/model-relationship-diagram` file.
1. Build it. From scratch.

This project is an opportunity for you to start from the ground up and build an
application. There's no `Gemfile`. No `config.ru`. No `app.rb`. Just a series of
mockups and some requirements.

When you, inevitably, get stuck; review the commits I'm making against a similar
application,
[can-i-eat-here](https://github.com/codeunion/can-i-eat-here).

I am building can-i-eat-here step by step, annotating the code, linking to
relevant documentation, and providing commentary in the commit messages

can-i-eat-here is intended for reference. Do not copy paste. Typing helps you
remember and forces you to think about every single bit of syntax. **Every time
a programmer copy pastes a kitten cries. Don't make the kitten cry.**

## Running The Software

bundle install --without production
cp .env.example .env
???rerun -c rackup (not sure if this will work on cloud9)
rerun -c "ruby air-stable.rb -o $IP -p $PORT" (this is works on cloud9)
Open it in your browser

## Deploying The Software

1. Install Heroku Tool belt https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart#step-2-install-the-heroku-toolbelt)
2. heroku createheroku config:set SESSION_SECRET=$ruby -r 'securereandom' -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(256)')
This sets a long random string the the app session secret
3. git push heroku
4. heroku open

### Obtain a Google Maps API Key
Google restricts your request to 2500 per day. To ger you own key:

Create a project at https://console.developers.google.com/project
Follow instructions to enable API access:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#api\_key
Get your "Public API Access" API Key from the "Apis & Auth" -> "Credentials" page
Update `GOOGLE_GEOCODER_API_KEY` in `.env` or via `heroku config:set`
